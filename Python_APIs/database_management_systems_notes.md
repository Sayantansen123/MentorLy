### ðŸ’¡ AI-Powered Features & Tips for Notion Integration:

*   **Smart Content Generation:**
    > Imagine using AI to automatically suggest related resources or sub-topics based on the `Topic to be covered` column. For example, if you type "Normalization," AI could suggest "Videos on BCNF" or "Practice problems for 3NF" and populate resource links.

*   **Automated Summaries & Flashcards:**
    > If you link your personal lecture notes or external articles to a page within Notion for each topic, an AI integration could then generate a concise summary of that content directly within your database view, aiding quick revision. Similarly, it could create flashcards based on key terms in your notes.

*   **Intelligent Q&A & Concept Reinforcement:**
    > By analyzing the `Concepts Learned` property and your linked notes, an AI could generate personalized quiz questions, explain complex ideas in simpler terms, or provide example scenarios for each topic to test your understanding.

*   **Progress Tracking & Personalized Recommendations:**
    > An AI could analyze your `Status` and `Difficulty` ratings for each topic to identify your strengths and weaknesses. It could then recommend specific areas for further study, suggest relevant external tutorials, or even propose a custom study plan to reinforce weaker areas.

*   **Resource Curation & Filtering:**
    > Based on your preferred learning style (e.g., prefer videos, text, interactive exercises) set in your Notion profile, an AI could filter and suggest curated external resources from platforms like YouTube, Coursera, or free academic courses specifically for each topic.
